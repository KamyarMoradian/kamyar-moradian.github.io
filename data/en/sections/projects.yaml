- name: Anti-Spoofing System for Facial Recognition
  role: Fundamentals of Computer Vision Course Project
  timeline: "Spring 2024"
  repo: https://github.com/KamyarMoradian/Anti-Spoofing-System # If your project is a public repo on GitHub, then provide this link. it will show star count.
  #url: ""  # If your project is not a public repo but it has a website or any external details url then provide it here. don't provide "repo" and "url" simultaneously.
  summary: Developed a real-time facial spoofing detection system using two distinct approaches. The first approach combined Feature Extraction, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to effectively reduce data dimensionality while maintaining high classification accuracy. The second approach utilized CNNs for deep learning-based spoof detection, allowing the model to learn complex features directly from raw images. Evaluated both methods, highlighting the strengths and trade-offs between traditional machine learning and modern deep learning techniques.

- name: Sentiment Analysis on Persian Text Using Natural Language Processing (NLP)
  role: Deep Learning Course Project
  timeline: "Fall 2023"
  repo: https://github.com/KamyarMoradian/NLP-Sentimental-Analysis
  #url: ""
  summary: Developed a sentiment analysis model for Persian text, detecting six key emotions—Anger, Fear, Happiness, Sadness, Wonder, and Hatred—using the XLM-RoBERTa transformer model. Preprocessed the text with NLP techniques and fine-tuned the model on the ArmanEmo dataset, achieving 75.23% accuracy, among the top accuracies of class. Conducted experiments to validate the model's robustness and compared performance across different architectures.
